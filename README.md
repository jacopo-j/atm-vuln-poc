# ATM Milano vulnerabilities proof of concept

This repository hosts a proof of concept for some vulnerabilities I found in ATM Milano's mobile application.

The vulnerabilities were disclosed to ATM and resolved before this repository was published, therefore this code does **not** work anymore. It may still be useful for research purposes.

For more information, [read my blog post](https://blog.jacopojannone.com/en/post/atm-app-vulnerability/).
